Popular Assemblies and Confederations
</title>
<description>
 &lt;p&gt;Communalism is an ideology and a political movement, which aims for a direct democracy.  It abandons capitalism as ecologically unsustainable and inhumane. However communalists do not seek an alternative by strengthening the state or taking over state power for themselves, but from a social order that rises from taking part in local popular assemblies and libertarian associations based on them.  Communalism provides a clear and practical proposal for political institutions and praxis that enable social freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;direct&amp;#95;democracy&quot;&gt;Direct democracy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to communalists, all political power should belong to local popular assemblies. True democracy can only be accomplished if people take part in open assemblies, where they can meet each other face-to-face and create social forms of action together.  Every member of a community should have an equal right to propose matters to their neighbourhoods popular assembly to decide upon and also to voice their opinions on them. No act is democratically justified if it is not directly proposed, discussed and decided on by the people – and not by any kind of  representative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing these jobs can, however, be left for committees or other forms of workgroups that execute the decisions of the assembly under their close scrutiny.  Membership in committees and workgroups, and also other jobs and responsibilities, can be rotated  regularly so that power doesn’t accumulate on omission to a few based on their  “expertise” or knowledge.  All members of a community don’t, of course, have to take part in all deciding about all issues, but all will have an equal possibility to take part in matters that are important to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;decentralizing&amp;#95;cities&quot;&gt;Decentralizing cities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of cities and municipalities is crucial to fulfilling communalist ideals of civic democracy and governance of cities and municipalities by their members.  Modern metropolitan cities have to be, in the end, decentralized to smaller municipalities and communities. This also has sound ecological reasons for it.  Physical decentralization of cities will of course take a long time, but they can be decentralized institutionally before that. Popular assemblies can at first work as networks in block, neighbourhood and city levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;municipalization&amp;#95;of&amp;#95;the&amp;#95;economy&quot;&gt;Municipalization of the economy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communalists propose that the economy should be municipalized and all privately owned land and factories and other production facilities should be moved to joint ownership by the municipality’s citizens.  Decisions about economic functions will be made by all members of the municipality in assemblies.  This would mean that economy as a whole will be brought into political decision-making and also that single factories or farms will no longer be competing entities.  In assemblies people would not only belong to their own profession with their own conflicting interests, but they would work for the benefit of the whole community. This way a basis could be created for an economy of purely ethical reasoning, where everyone would give according to their abilities and receive according to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;confederalism&quot;&gt;Confederalism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All economic activity or decision-making  doesn’t need – or have– to be limited to areas where people can congregate to meet in assemblies. Communalists propose a confederation as democratical and libertarian municipal alliances. It is a network of administrative councils whose members are selected face-to-face in assemblies. The delegates can be recalled and changed at any moment and they are responsible to the assemblies that have chosen them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assemblies also carefully regulate the delegates and give guidelines to their action.  In fact they are more messengers of assemblies rather then representatives, since representatives make decisions for the communities that they represent.  Decision-making and making policy decisions will be solely the right of the assemblies. Only administration and coordination are the responsibilities of confederal councils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If members of a confederation cannot get to a agreement through their delegates, a confederation-wide general election can be held, where the common policy of municipalities will be decided.  When creating a confederation there can be an agreement among members that functions as a sort of a constitution for the confederation and that defines every member community’s rights. For example how they can resign from the confederation and what kind of issues can be decided in whole confederation-wide general elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An agreement like this would on one hand secure the rights of communities and the people who live in them against the arbitrariness of the majority opinion and also would make possible action in the case of a single community polluting other communities areas.  Also confederalism would prevent local communities from relapsing to parochialism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also economic cooperation should be expanded to cover the whole confederation. ideally, communities would combine their strengths in local confederal networks that would join even larger – ultimately even worldwide – networks where production and distribution is planned according to the needs of a community and their possiblities for production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;assemblies&amp;#95;as&amp;#95;a&amp;#95;force&amp;#95;for&amp;#95;change&quot;&gt;Assemblies as a force for change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most important methods when striving for communalism are starting local assemblies, strengthening and making their power legally binding and radically democratizing existing municipal institutions. Local assemblies should also create confederalist networks with other communities, so that the movement can rise to be national and even international.  This way directly democratic political institutions would exist already before abandoning the old social order and a relapse to oligarchy would be unlikely after a revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The functioning of assemblies could create many needed reforms in people’s lives already when political power officially belongs to the state and state-like municipal structures. When they develop assemblies will most likely come to a conflict with state institutions and the capitalist economy, because power cannot exist simultaneously belong to both the state and corporations that govern the economy and the people in directly democratic institutions. This way a revolutionary tension will form, that causes assemblies to take all political power to themselves and their confederation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to starting assemblies communalists also favor co-ops and other co-operative forms of educational alternative economy.  However these should be regarded as mostly educational, because staying alive in the market and growing to challenge capitalism is quite unlikely. Rather these islands of an alternative economy must copy ever more practices from regular companies and they must adapt to existing economy according to Its terms.  True struggle is fought over political power that must also be used to force economic activity to become part of assemblies’ direct governance.&lt;/p&gt;

Libertarian Municipalism
</title>
<description>
 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Libertarian municipalism is a political program developed by libertarian socialist theorist Murray Bookchin, to create democratic citizens' assemblies in towns and urban neighborhoods. The assemblies in these free municipalities join together to replace the state with a directly democratic confederation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_municipalism'&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murray Bookchin, an American eco-anarchist who became a self-styled “communalist,” proposed the idea of “libertarian municipalism” — a notion that relied on the development of confederal political structures as a counter-power to the centralized nation-state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In The Next Revolution, Bookchin broadly outlines a program and rough design of libertarian municipalism and anti-state confederalism of cities and towns. Within cities, he discusses the possibilities of advancing a minimum policy program and maximum program. The former meets demands for improved welfare of residents and generates pockets of direct participation and empowerment that can serve as stepping stones to more wholesale institutional transformation. The maximum program is one in which people power is at the center of this institutional transformation: here, decision-making power is transferred from municipal-level representative institutions to that of direct-democratic assemblies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Bookchin, one approach to achieving both the minimum and maximum program is to “electorally” engage “in a potentially important center of power — the municipal council,” so as to “compel it to create legislatively potent neighborhood assemblies.” More specifically, Bookchin writes that “communalists do not hesitate to run candidates in municipal elections who, if elected, would use what real power their offices confer to legislate popular assemblies into existence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken a step further, Bookchin writes that “a confederalist alternative would be based on a network of policy-making popular assemblies with recallable deputies to local and regional confederal councils — councils whose sole function, I must emphasize, would be to adjudicate differences and undertake strictly administrative tasks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janet Biehl, Bookchin’s longtime intellectual partner, writes that “city charters or other constitutions would be altered to legitimate the power of the assemblies in local self-government.” Many on the Left — including anarchists — are paying closer attention to the role of constitutions. One may even take this further and look at possibilities for advancing a post-state monetary system that is consistent with confederalism, such as that outlined by Nathan Cedric Tankus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the complications might be in terms of the relationship between policymaking and administration, representation and direct participation and other issues, Bookchin’s broader point is that municipalities can be the site of institutional transformation and the material bases for the construction of a viable counter-power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://roarmag.org/essays/us-anti-fascism-municipalism/'&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further Reading:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://roarmag.org/essays/us-anti-fascism-municipalism/'&gt;Is America ready for a municipalist movement?&lt;/a&gt; Roar Magazine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-libertarian-municipalism-an-overview'&gt;Libertarian Municipalism: An Overview&lt;/a&gt; by Murray Bookchin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/libmuni.html'&gt;Libertarian Municipalism: The New Municipal Agenda&lt;/a&gt; by Murray Bookchin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/lib-municipalism/'&gt;Libertarian Municipalism Keynote Speech&lt;/a&gt; by Janet Biehl&lt;/p&gt;

What is Capitalism?
</title>
<description>
 &lt;p&gt; From long-time ISE faculty member, Peter Staudenmeier, written for the Lexicon pamphlet series sponsored by the Institute for Anarchist Studies. This was originally posted in March 2014 and revised in August 2015:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ancient myths of paradise, people lived in boundless plenty without work or want. The fruits of the earth were freely available to all and no labor was necessary. If life under capitalism is a far cry from paradise, it is nonetheless beholden to its own myths of work, prosperity, and progress. Understanding what the world was like before the rise of capitalism, and envisioning a different world beyond the capitalist reality we live in today, calls for an examination of its myths and the structures on which those myths are built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capitalism usually presents itself as an economic system, a way of organizing the production and distribution of goods and services, of wealth and welfare, of material gain and loss. But capitalism is more than an economic system, it is a form of society: A society in which the economic has taken precedence over the social. Under capitalism, economic necessities become more important than basic social relationships – finding a job and keeping it can be more pressing than creating a fulfilling life together with friends and companions and loved ones; figuring out how to pay the rent or maintain the mortgage or make sure there’s food on the table wins out over exploring what we have in common; worrying about who’ll take care of us when we’re too old to work gets in the way of taking care of each other here and now. W hat is best for me individually becomes more vital than what is best for the communities I am part of, than what is best for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we find ourselves thinking this way, it is not because we are inherently selfish beings. That notion of natural self-interest and acquisitiveness is one of the major myths of modern capitalism. Human societies have evolved myriad ways of arranging their economic interactions, many of them based squarely on communal rather than individual standards of well-being. They aren’t always liberatory, of course, but they do indicate that capitalism’s peculiar preoccupation with concern for oneself over others is not built in to human nature. And most people don’t get all that far under capitalism, economically speaking, no matter how much we focus on our own needs and wants. Though the free market continually holds out the promise of a better life for all, the promise generally becomes reality for only a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewed in this context, capitalism is by no means historically inevitable. It isn’t part of the fabric of the universe and it isn’t a consequence of the laws of physics. It is not an innate attribute of human existence. It is not, as it pretends to be, the natural state of economic affairs. Capitalism is a social artifact, something created and maintained by people, by our actions and inactions, whether deliberate or inadvertent, whether malevolent or well-meaning. It arose in particular places at specific times under distinctive conditions. It has a history, though admirers of capitalism sometimes like to portray it as timeless. Like everything historical, it has both beginnings and an end. If we made it, we can unmake it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means understanding how it functions. To do this we can draw on both theory and practice, incorporating the lessons learned from critical analyses of the basic structures of capitalism as well as the legacies of organized opposition to those structures. W e can make use of the insights generated by radical social movements throughout the long history of emancipatory struggles against capitalism. Many of these struggles were led by workers in class-based movements resisting the growing power of capital. Others were made up of peasants or artisans, and some were community-based movements defending popular institutions from encroachment by an advancing capitalist system. The participants in these struggles disagreed about how to make sense of capitalism’s seemingly senseless rules, but we can distill a series of key concepts from their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of these oppositional movements and their assessment of a world transformed according to capitalist imperatives, the core features of capitalism as an economic system and as a society can be characterized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;commodity&amp;#95;production&amp;#95;and&amp;#95;exchange.&quot;&gt;Commodity production and exchange.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commodities are the fundamental unit of capitalist societies, as the cell is the fundamental unit of the body. Under full-fledged capitalism a commodity can be just about anything – something useful and necessary, something harmful and pointless, something rare or common, something intangible and ephemeral. W hat makes an item or an idea or an action a commodity is not some intrinsic quality of the thing itself, but its status as an object of exchange. In its simplest form, a commodity is a good or a service that is produced in order to be exchanged. It is valuable not primarily for what it is, but for what price it can fetch when bought or sold, what can be gained by exchanging it for other commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;markets.&quot;&gt;Markets.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism through which commodities are exchanged is the market, a forum in which buyers and sellers compete for advantage. Historically markets were subject to social constraints: typically located in circumscribed areas, limited to certain times of the day or week or year, tempered by ethical stipulations. Many human societies assigned markets a deliberately subordinate position in communal life and delineated clear boundaries within which markets were allowed to operate. This changed with the ascendance of capitalism. In an ideal capitalist world, markets and their competitive dynamic no longer heed social limitations but are ubiquitous and unfettered; they are everywhere all the time. Though championed for their supposed efficiency, markets are frequently models of extraordinary waste and inefficiency. In their capitalist form markets have a tendency to permeate all relationships and all dimensions of social life, extending far beyond the immediate economic realm and turning neighbors into rivals, colleagues into competitors, allies into adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;property&amp;#95;as&amp;#95;private&amp;#95;investment.&quot;&gt;Property as private investment.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the processes of commodity production and market exchange, more and more aspects of human life and the natural world are reduced to assets that can and must be owned. W ealth comes from the earth and its creatures and from the work of human hands and minds, and there are countless forms in which it can be created, discovered, and shared. Many of these forms have been communal, collective, cooperative. Capitalism imposes one form as paramount: private ownership of resources. In contemporary industrial capitalist societies this type of private property takes the shape of entrepreneurs who own a business, shareholders or investors who own a corporation, landlords who own real estate, speculators who own stock or trade debt and credit and abstract commodities existing only in notional form. The driving force behind this kind of ownership is profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;exploited&amp;#95;labor.&quot;&gt;Exploited labor.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people in capitalist contexts don’t own assets that earn profit, and have to sell their time and effort in order to make a living. Selling your ability to work in exchange for a paycheck is known as wage labor, the component of capitalism with which most of us are intimately familiar. A division of labor between groups of people doing different tasks is not peculiar to capitalism, but in combination with commodity production, the predominance of the market, and private ownership of economic resources, the exploitation of labor means that the people who actually produce the goods and services that keep the system running have little say in how the things they produce are made and distributed. Those decisions are normally the prerogative of owners, executives, and managers, whose directives are supposed to be carried out by workers. W hen the system works the way it is designed, products end up in the hands of consumers divorced from any connection with or knowledge of the producers or their conditions of work, from mass manufacturing to the provision of services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the basis of these intertwined core features, capitalism has achieved remarkable levels of economic innovation and equally remarkable levels of ecological and social destructiveness. W hat drives both its accomplishments and its devastation is a constant requirement for accumulation, for increasing returns on investment, for profits that can be put back into circulation in order to yield even greater profit. Ever-expanding material reward is the carrot that entices capitalist ambitions, accompanied by the stick of potential economic ruin. W hile its operations are baroquely complex and often inscrutable, its underlying principles are starkly straightforward. This accounts for capitalism’s conspicuous flexibility, the capacity to accommodate itself to widely different social and cultural contexts. It also accounts for the profoundly alienated relationships at the heart of capitalist society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because capitalism is built around recurrent crises, economic and otherwise, it has always sparked dissatisfaction and resistance. From anarchists to marxists, from cooperative movements to anti-colonial struggles, diverse groups and individuals have contested the regime of capital for generations. For those of us fundamentally opposed to capitalism, it is crucial to keep in mind the political ambivalence of discontent with capitalist norms. History is littered with false alternatives to an inhumane and unsustainable system. Stalinism, to choose one all too recognizable example, is not a compelling replacement for free market nostrums. Many populists and fascists also oppose capitalism, based often enough on the alluring but deceptive paradigm of hardworking producers versus parasitic financiers. There are numerous authoritarian and right-wing versions of anti-capitalist sentiment. W e need to remember this if we don’t want to end up in a future that is even worse than the capitalist present. The challenge is to come up with a comprehensive critical analysis of what is wrong with capitalism and a plausible array of alternative social institutions that could supplant it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A helpful step toward that goal is to ask questions without easy answers. W hat is it about capitalism that we oppose? Its outsize impact on our lives, our character, our bodies, our planet? Its privileging of multinational corporations and millionaires? Its cosmopolitanism and its corrosive effect on traditional mores? Or is it alienation and exploitation that we reject? And what are we working toward? A more smoothly functioning liberal state that will provide for all? Local self-sufficiency and regional autarky? Planning bureaucracies and legislated equality? Environmental enterprise and reduced consumption? Neighborhood markets and family farms and mom and pop stores? Or do we want a genuinely anti-capitalist alternative, structurally antagonistic to hierarchy and domination, to profit and property, whatever their scale or scope?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond decisive questions like these, there are many other problems to be thought through and worked out. Capitalism is not as all-encompassing as it appears; non- capitalist relationships exist within and alongside the dominant economy and society. And as central as production is to economic endeavors, reproduction and care are what make our lives possible, while the pleasure of personal and collective creation for its own sake, regardless of utility, can make our lives worth living. Indeed the very notion of ‘the economy’ as a separate sphere of social life is itself a legacy of the historical emergence of capitalism. Today’s shifting affiliations linking capitalism to the state, to white supremacy, to patriarchy, to racial and gender and other hierarchies are not an implacable constant but always in flux, with oppressive as well as subversive potentials. The crushing weight of capital distorts any image of a life after capitalism, but the possibilities of transcending its bitter strictures are entirely real. They are ours to explore, ours to construct, and ours to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;about&amp;#95;the&amp;#95;author:&amp;#95;peter&amp;#95;staudenmaier&quot;&gt;About the Author: Peter Staudenmaier&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Staudenmaier is a social ecologist and historian who has been involved with the Institute for Social Ecology since 1989.
